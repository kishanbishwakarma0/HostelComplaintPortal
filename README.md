## Java Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept | Where Applied |
|---|---|
| Abstract class | `User` — base class for `Student` and `Staff` |
| Inheritance | `Student extends User`, `Staff extends User` |
| Polymorphism | `getDashboardTitle()` and `toString()` overridden in both subclasses |
| Enum | `ComplaintStatus` (PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, RESOLVED) |
| Collections | `List<Complaint>`, `List<User>`, `Map<ComplaintStatus, Long>` |
| Streams and lambdas | Filtering, searching, and counting complaints |
| File I/O | `BufferedReader` and `PrintWriter` for persistent text file storage |
| Serializable | `User` and `Complaint` implement `Serializable` |
| GUI (Swing) | Login screen, dual dashboards, dialogs, tables, custom renderers |
| Event handling | `ActionListener`, `DocumentListener`, `MouseAdapter` |
